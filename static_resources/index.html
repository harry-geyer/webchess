            • Drag and drop pieces on the board to make your move.<br>
            • Press Get to let the engine calculate its move.<br>
            • The Move Generator dropdown lets you choose different move-generation strategies.<br>
            • Captured pieces appear in the bar below the board.<br>
            • Press Reset at any time to start a new game.

        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            This is chess. It is a project I made because I've always
            enjoyed chess and always been interested in implementing
            different strategies.
            <br>
            The frontend interface is written with HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript, but the engine and move generator is written in
            C. Currently this is compiled into WebAssembly with
            emscripten. The benefits of that is because it can be done
            locally, meaning no expensive backend load, but I plan to
            add a game mode to have the chess engine run on a server,
            and the javascript communicate through a REST API to the
            chess engine. The engine being written in C means that
            compiling into a native binary will be easier than rewriting
            the engine and maintains the (potential) high efficiency of
            C programs.
            <br>
            In fact, the engine is currently compiled into a native
            dynamic library for the unit tests. See
            <a href=/coverage/>here</a> for the coverage results of the
            unit tests.
